# Gdl-DDI-Predictions
For this project we were tasked to rank within the top 3 positions
in one of the datasets from the Open Graph Benchmark project.
We decided to work with one of the datasets from the Link Property prediction subset,
called  ogbl-ddi. The data from the dataset is made up of drug-drug interactions (DDI),
which is when medications interact with one or more different medications.
This prediction task is a challenging problem being researched because it's critical to
be able to identify the potential DDI's in clinical trials. Existing machine learning models
already deal with the task of link prediction, which normally involves dealing with incomplete
graphs and being able to correctly predict a connection between two nodes.

The repo contains two jupiter notebooks, which are self-contained in execution.
Giving access to drive through Google Colab's API allows you to write a .txt log of the training epochs.
